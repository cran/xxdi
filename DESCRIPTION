Description: Institutional performance assessment remains a key challenge to a multitude of stakeholders. Existing indicators such as h-type indicators, g-type indicators, and many others do not reflect expertise of institutions that defines their research portfolio. The package offers functionality to compute two novel indices: the x-index and the xd-index. The x-index evaluates an institution's scholarly expertise within a specific discipline or field, while the xd-index provides a broader assessment of overall scholarly expertise considering an institution's publication pattern and strengths across coarse thematic areas. These indices offer a nuanced understanding of institutional research capabilities, aiding stakeholders in research management and resource allocation decisions.
